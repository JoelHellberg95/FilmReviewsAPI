# FilmRecensioner API Documentation
>[!NOTE]
>Below you will find the documentation for this project.

### API Structure

The API is divided into two main controllers: ReviewsController and VideosController.

Each controller handles its respective data objects (Review and Video). 

Both controller classes are decorated with [ApiController] and use [Authorize] to require authentication for certain actions.

# Analysis and Reflection

## Performance
When it comes to how fast the API works, using techniques like asynchronous methods and Entity Framework helps it perform well. To make it even faster, we could add a system called caching. This helps by saving some information, so the API doesn't have to check the database every time, making things quicker.

## Scalability
If we want the API to handle more users or data in the future, we can make it more scalable. This involves using some tricks like caching, choosing databases that can handle a lot of information, and using a CDN (content delivery network) to share static content faster. We might also think about balancing the workload and using smaller, specialized parts of the API to manage increased demand.

## Security
To keep things secure, the API already checks if you're allowed to do certain things by using your username and password. But we could do more! Adding things like a secure connection (HTTPS), and protection against sneaky attacks (like SQL injection) would make it even more secure.

## Maintainability
The way the code is organized makes it easy to understand and work with. We use some modern tools to manage the database, and we have clear ways to send data back and forth between the website and the server. The documentation, which is like a guide for using the API, helps us keep everything in good shape and make changes without causing problems.

# After thoughts
In general i thought this was a good challenge, using the knowledge from the last API project and the video material from both Udemy and Linus on canvas made this project easier to complete.
But in honesty it was a headache at sometimes. I am now looking forward to the next part where we will add a UI.
